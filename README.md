# Enterprise GenAI Architecture & Context Engineering Portfolio

This repository documents my hands-on transition from enterprise technical delivery leadership into **GenAI architecture, context engineering, and governance-by-design**.

The focus is on how GenAI systems are **designed, constrained, evaluated, and operationalized** in real-world enterprise environments — not on prompt tricks or isolated experimentation.

This is a system-level portfolio demonstrating how GenAI can be made **scalable, auditable, and defensible**.

## What This Repository Is (and Is Not)

### This repository **is**:
- An enterprise-focused GenAI architecture lab
- A practical exploration of **context engineering and orchestration**
- A study of **retrieval strategies (RAG)** beyond naïve vector search
- A governance-first approach to GenAI system design
- A documented learning environment aligned to production realities

### This repository **is not**:
- A collection of prompt hacks
- A claim of production AI ownership
- A model training or research project
